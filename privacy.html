    <ul>
        <li><strong>Application</strong> refers to sky story, the software program provided by the Company.</li>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>"sky story" collects your device's location information (latitude and longitude) while you are using the app. This information is required to provide localized weather updates tailored to your current location.</p>

    <p>We do not collect other personal data such as names, email addresses, or usage information unrelated to location.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Location Data</h2>
    <p>We use your location data solely to fetch weather information from a trusted third-party weather service, the OpenWeather API. Your geographic coordinates are transmitted securely over HTTPS to OpenWeather to provide accurate, localized weather forecasts.</p>

    <p>We do not use location data for advertising, marketing, analytics, or any other purpose beyond providing weather information.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing and Security</h2>
    <p>Your location data is shared only with OpenWeather as described above. We do not share your location data with any other third parties.</p>

    <p>All data transmitted to OpenWeather is encrypted in transit using HTTPS to protect against interception.</p>

    <h2>Your Control and Choices</h2>
    <p>You have control over whether you share your location with "sky story." The app will request your permission before accessing location services.</p>
    <p>You can choose to deny or revoke location access at any time in your device settings. Without location access, the app’s weather functionality will be limited.</p>

    <h2>No Collection of Other Personal Data</h2>
    <p>Other than location data as described above, "sky story" does not collect or store any personal data or usage information.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. As We do not knowingly collect personal data from children below 13, we comply with applicable children's privacy protections.</p>

    <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
    <p>Our Service may contain links to other websites not operated by Us. Please review the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. We will notify you by posting the updated policy with a new “Last updated” date. You are encouraged to review this policy periodically.</p>
